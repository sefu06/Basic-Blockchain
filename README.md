# BASIC BLOCKCHAIN PART 1

## What is a blockchain?
A Blockchain is a chain where each block represents a transaction and contains data (hash, userID, date, previous block's hash). 
<br>
A defining feature of the blockchain is that each block in the chain must contain a **hash**. A hash is a unique digital footprint, 
<br> It’s produced by running data through a hash function; in this blockchain, I used SHA-256 (same as Bitcoin). <br>

A hash is super important for any data that is sensitive or needs to be protected.

**Data Integrity (Tamper Detection)**

Each block stores its own hash and the hash of the previous block.

If someone changes data in one block, its hash changes — and the link to the next block breaks immediately.

This makes it obvious that the blockchain has been tampered with.

**Immutability**

Because every block depends on the previous block’s hash, you’d have to recompute all subsequent hashes to hide any change — nearly impossible in large blockchains.

**Efficient Verification**

Hashes make it easy to check that data hasn’t changed without re-reading the entire block.

They’re like quick “checksums” to ensure authenticity.



A cryptographic hash function (e.g. SHA-256) is deterministic: the same input always produces the same output hash.
Example: hash("hello") → some fixed 256-bit value every time.

A good cryptographic hash is one-way (preimage resistant): given only the hash, you cannot feasibly reconstruct the original input by any direct mathematical inversion.

So: you can compute the hash from the data, but you cannot (practically) recover the data from the hash.
